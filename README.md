# Hi, I'm Amanda 👋

I'm a master's student in Applied & Computational Mathematics at KTH, 
specializing in Mathematics of Data Science. I enjoy working on problems
in machine learning, numerical methods and optimization.

## 🔭 What I work on
- Gaussian process models for classification
- Numerical linear algebra and matrix computations
- Random walk simulations and stochastic processes
- Optimization and decision models (e.g. spare part allocation, EBO)

## 🧰 Tech & tools
- Python (NumPy, pandas, SciPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
- MATLAB, LaTeX
- Version control with Git & GitHub

## 📂 Selected projects
- **Gaussian Process Classification of Handwritten Digits** – Binary classifier using Gaussian Processes in scikit-learn, exploring uncertainty and decision boundaries.
- **Random Walk Simulation & RMS Analysis** – 3D random walk simulator with self-avoiding constraints and RMS end-to-end distance analysis.
- **Spare Part Allocation Optimization** – Dynamic programming and heuristic optimization to minimize Expected Backorder under budget constraints.

## 🌱 Currently learning
- More advanced probabilistic models
- Practical ML workflows for real-world data
- Regression analysis
